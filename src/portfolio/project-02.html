                This project is a library written in java for feed forward, fully connected, neural networks. This
                project
                was written as a learning experiance to understand matrix calculus better and how simple neural networks
                work. I wrote both the matrix math library (for handling all the matrix math required by the neural
                network) and the neural network library completely from scratch.

                As a demonstation of the libraries functionality I tested it on the "Hello World" of Neural networks,
                identifiying handwritten numbers. Using the MNIST data set (of 70 000, 32x32px images), I was able to
                train a neural network to identify numbers with greater than 80% accuracy with only one pass over the
                training data. I also used this topic for my Math IB internal assessment. Learn more on my GitHub!
