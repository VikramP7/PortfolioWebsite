                Design project for our second year electrical engineering design class (ENEL 300) at the Schulich 
                School of Engineering at University of Calgary. The semester long project was to create a remote control car.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our car integrates a variety of features including distance measurement, metal detection, togglable head/tail lights, 
                tank steering, and more. These features are implemented through 3 custom PCBs, designed in Altium or KiCad. 
                Wireless locomotion control and light control is implemented using the HC-05 Bluetooth transceiver module. The brains
                of the car was an AVR128DB28 microcontroller and was used to do I2C and USART communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The physical design was inspired by a RAM 3500 Cummins 6.7 Twin Turbo and its stereotypical owner. 
                This allowed us to bring a part of Alberta culture to the academic environment through innovation and design.
